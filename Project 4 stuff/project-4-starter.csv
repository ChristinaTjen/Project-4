About the job
Moneysmart is hiring a Data Team lead to help lead our team of young, eager data engineers and analysts. Together you and your team will work to build a stable and scalable data infrastructure that will be able to help the business to collect, process and store masses of raw information securely, accurately and efficiently. With all that information on hand, we’ll be looking to you to help us design and build amazing data products to improve user experiences on our Moneysmart sites as well as build up the business intelligence capabilities within our organization.
We’re looking for someone who is experienced and has done similar work like this elsewhere before. You will be working closely with people from other departments like Product, Marketing and Strategy to help understand their needs and design solutions that will enable them to deliver on their goals. Examples of this could be:
Onboarding customer data from external systems so further analysis can be conducted on it and we can discover/better understand customer preferences and trends
Building a recommendation engine that can recommend products based on user’s past choices, creating a more personalized and desirable experience
Creating a near real time reporting platform so that the country managers can get information in a more timely manner to make decisions quickly
To be able to do all these, you’ll need to plan and manage the Data Team’s roadmap well and help prioritize the work that needs to be done so that we can see the awesome impact it could bring sooner rather than later.
You will be expected to be technical as well. Being able to build data pipelines, write code and tune database queries will be a requirement since you’ll need to review and vet the work your team has done. The engineers will be looking to you to learn about best practices in building pipelines and running analysis, industry standards on data infrastructure and what clean, maintainable code looks like. The team currently writes most of their code in Python and SQL at the moment (we use R sometimes as well). But fluency in any other Big Data framework language will be highly welcome.
Our data engineers and analysts are a smart and talented bunch but they will require leadership and direction from their lead (which is you), someone who has been through the many phases of what it takes to build and maintain a production level data infrastructure, has seen the pitfalls and can help show them the way. Besides providing technical expertise to the team, a core part of this role will be to help mentor and develop the members of your team (as well as other developers in our department) professionally, and work towards creating a conducive environment for developers to thrive, making Moneysmart an ideal place to work and grow your career.
If you’re ready to take up the important mantle of become a Data Team Lead in Moneysmart’s Technology department, send us your resume now! We would really love to hear from you.","Requirements

The Research Associate will join an expanding research group that works on security and privacy issues in data analytics and networked systems. Under the guidance of Dr. Jun Zhao (Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU), the Research Associate has the opportunity to work on one of the following problems:
building privacy-preserving, attack-resilient machine learning and data analytics, 
using blockchains and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to address security in the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing, and
developing privacy-aware and trustworthy social networks.
In problem 1 above, topics include incorporating differential privacy and defending against adversarial examples in deep learning. Apple and Google have lately implemented differential privacy in their data analysis procedures. Deep learning was recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are maliciously crafted samples to trigger misbehavior of the systems. Hence, adversarial machine learning and security in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems will also be studied.

In problem 2 above, the unique challenges in IoT security result from the heterogeneity among devices and service providers, and the massive-scale, geographically distributed data in IoT applications. Also, due to limited memory in the enclave provided in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), challenges exist when the technology is applied to cloud computing and secure databases. There will be collaborations with experts in top technology companies.
In problem 3 above, social networks such as Facebook and Google+ interconnect users via relationships. Topics include developing defense mechanisms to alleviate the threat of fake accounts and analyzing social network data to mitigate risks to individual privacy.

End-to-end Deep Learning Algorithm Development for Autonomous Level 5 Vehicles
TUMCREATE Phase II in Singapore
Individual Mobility Vehicles and Services (IMVS)
Availability: January 2019
Working location: Singapore
Send applications to: aybike.ongel@tum-create.edu.sg
Background
TUMCREATE is a joint interdisciplinary research programme between the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore with funding from the National Research Foundation (NRF). It conducts research in transportation planning, intelligent transportation systems, autonomous and electric mobility, and power generation and distribution for vehicle charging.
The IMVS team in TUMCREATE develops concepts and technologies for a new electrified and autonomous vehicle for Singapore. This vehicle will be operated in a new public transportation system with adapted infrastructure and dynamic routing. The impacts of such a system, in terms of costs, energy consumption, and road infrastructure, are investigated.
Objective & Tasks
The elimination of the driver poses numerous challenges in the development of level 5 vehicles. In addition to control using classic control algorithms, it is also possible to completely control the vehicle via an artificial neural network using the ""end-to-end deep learning approach"". This artificial neural network is only trained by images and vehicle data, so that it can completely take over the driving task.
IMVS team is looking for a PhD candidate with deep knowledge in autonomous driving and a great enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The candidate will develop an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for the complete control of an autonomous vehicle. This novel approach will then be compared with conventional methods of autonomous vehicle control. The project work will be carried out in Singapore.

Who we are:
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
What the role is:
You will work on both small and large scale projects, building and maintaining the infrastructure behind them. We are fully aligned with the Government’s cloud-first policy and you will bring capability to help us realise this. The role includes:

WHAT WE DO
We invite you to be part of our ambitious, close-knit team creating systems for large customers who need to crunch through Tbps of data in real-time. Our approach is relentless performance-oriented software engineering vs. server sprawl in our customers' datacentres.
You will use the latest high-end hardware and continuously devise ways to push the envelope of software performance.
We build in-house systems if we must. We had to for indexing 1M 60-column rows/s, for aggregating high throughput event streams over hundreds of combinations of dimensions, and for pattern matching 5M patterns at 100Gb/s per 2RU. We use these to solve real customer problems.
You will experiment wildly. For example we implemented network monitoring using a GPU, and we tested 4-socket machines with 2T RAM. Our current favourite platform is a 2-socket system with E5-2699v4 CPUs (88 lcores in total), 4x40Gbps NICs and 1T RAM, which we use to process 160Gbps.
You will help us build a successful software platform for the long run. We invest a lot in flexibility, such as with our extensible rule engine and declarative aggregation system that empowers our analysts and helps us minimise the C code we have to write for supporting disparate use-cases.
We know the devil is in the details. You will improve performance through better memory allocation systems and better data structures, all while ensuring that they are integrated with Address Sanitizer and fully tested using unit tests and end-to-end regression tests.
We work end-to-end. You will implement data engineering solutions that are both efficient and secure for handling events from 500 million users, and to extract insight without leaking individual information.
We want to show off. To attract the best programmers we plan to showcase our technology. You can be part of our effort to open-source interesting pieces of our technology stack.
  YOUR ROLE AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE DATA ENGINEER
As a High-Performance Data Engineer, you will create and maintain tools, mainly in C, for crunching large amounts of data in files or streams.
You will have to think both big, in terms of overall architecture, and small, in terms of low-level optimisations, to deliver solutions that are reusable, and match the performance of the best hardware.
Every capability you add directly translates to new offerings made possible. Every percent of performance improvement directly translates to large cost savings. At the same time, the correctness and reliability of your work will be the cornerstone to our customers’ trust.","Requirements

The Research Associate will join an expanding research group that works on security and privacy issues in data analytics and networked systems. Under the guidance of Dr. Jun Zhao (Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU), the Research Associate has the opportunity to work on one of the following problems:
building privacy-preserving, attack-resilient machine learning and data analytics, 
using blockchains and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to address security in the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing, and
developing privacy-aware and trustworthy social networks.
In problem 1 above, topics include incorporating differential privacy and defending against adversarial examples in deep learning. Apple and Google have lately implemented differential privacy in their data analysis procedures. Deep learning was recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are maliciously crafted samples to trigger misbehavior of the systems. Hence, adversarial machine learning and security in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems will also be studied.

In problem 2 above, the unique challenges in IoT security result from the heterogeneity among devices and service providers, and the massive-scale, geographically distributed data in IoT applications. Also, due to limited memory in the enclave provided in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), challenges exist when the technology is applied to cloud computing and secure databases. There will be collaborations with experts in top technology companies.
In problem 3 above, social networks such as Facebook and Google+ interconnect users via relationships. Topics include developing defense mechanisms to alleviate the threat of fake accounts and analyzing social network data to mitigate risks to individual privacy.

Background
TUMCREATE is a joint interdisciplinary research programme between the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore with funding from the National Research Foundation (NRF). It conducts research in transportation planning, intelligent transportation systems, autonomous and electric mobility, and power generation and distribution for vehicle charging.
The IMVS team in TUMCREATE develops concepts and technologies for a new electrified and autonomous vehicle for Singapore. This vehicle will be operated in a new public transportation system with adapted infrastructure and dynamic routing. The impacts of such a system, in terms of costs, energy consumption, and road infrastructure, are investigated.
Objective & Tasks
The elimination of the driver poses numerous challenges in the development of level 5 vehicles. In addition to control using classic control algorithms, it is also possible to completely control the vehicle via an artificial neural network using the ""end-to-end deep learning approach"". This artificial neural network is only trained by images and vehicle data, so that it can completely take over the driving task.
IMVS team is looking for a PhD candidate with deep knowledge in autonomous driving and a great enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The candidate will develop an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for the complete control of an autonomous vehicle. This novel approach will then be compared with conventional methods of autonomous vehicle control. The project work will be carried out in Singapore.

Job Summary:
The Berkley Educational Alliance for Research in Singapore Ltd. (BEARS) is a not-for profit entity incorporated in Singapore, managed by the University of California, at Berkeley (UCB) and funded by Singapore’s National Research Foundation. Its purpose is to carry out multi-year research projects in collaboration with universities and agencies in Singapore.
We are looking for a highly motivated person to fill the position of Postdoctoral Scholar to conduct and support the research work in the project “High efficiency, commercially viable halide perovskite solar cells,” which is being performed in a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and BEARS.  The Postdoctoral Scholar will have to work closely with BEARS and NTU PIs and research staff to contribute to achieving the overall objectives of the research programme.
The personnel hired will design and perform high-throughput computation (HTC) using first principles methods to determine the electronic structures of materials in the halide perovskite family. The scholar will search for non-toxic (minimally-toxic) alternatives to the lead-containing compounds which are currently used. Specifically, multi-cation substitution into perovskite and perovskite related structures and the replacement of Pb with divalent, trivalent, or tetravalent cations will be evaluated. It is noted that the composition space for the proposed structures may exceed 106 combinations, so it will be necessary to use sparse/intelligent sampling and machine learning to reduce the required computational time. Materials with suitable band gaps for application in photovoltaic devices will undergo more detailed computational screening based on their charge carrier screening, defect formation energies, and excited state properties. The most promising compounds will be synthesized and evaluated in collaboration with experimentalists in the project. 
The appointment is for an initial period of one year with possibility of renewal.
Duties & Responsibilities:
Perform high-throughput computation (HTC) using first principles methods to determine the electronic structures of materials in the halide perovskite family
Design and implement methods to efficiently identify halide perovskite materials which will be promising as photovoltaic absorbers
Collaborate with experimentalists in the project to select promising materials for synthesis and use experimental results to benchmark theoretical predictions, using continuum simulations as required. 
Assess, interpret and evaluate outcomes of research.
Resolve problems of meeting research objectives and deadlines.
Develop ideas for application of research outcomes
Author and publish research articles
Present the research results at participating conferences and/or at programme reviews

The Research Associate will join an expanding research group that works on security and privacy issues in data analytics and networked systems. Under the guidance of Dr. Jun Zhao (Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU), the Research Associate has the opportunity to work on one of the following problems:
building privacy-preserving, attack-resilient machine learning and data analytics, 
using blockchains and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to address security in the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing, and
developing privacy-aware and trustworthy social networks.
In problem 1 above, topics include incorporating differential privacy and defending against adversarial examples in deep learning. Apple and Google have lately implemented differential privacy in their data analysis procedures. Deep learning was recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are maliciously crafted samples to trigger misbehavior of the systems. Hence, adversarial machine learning and security in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems will also be studied.

In problem 2 above, the unique challenges in IoT security result from the heterogeneity among devices and service providers, and the massive-scale, geographically distributed data in IoT applications. Also, due to limited memory in the enclave provided in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), challenges exist when the technology is applied to cloud computing and secure databases. There will be collaborations with experts in top technology companies.
In problem 3 above, social networks such as Facebook and Google+ interconnect users via relationships. Topics include developing defense mechanisms to alleviate the threat of fake accounts and analyzing social network data to mitigate risks to individual privacy.

Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:
We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)
In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.
Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.

We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)
In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively.

Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss.

About Tookitaki
Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:
We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)
In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.
Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.
Role: Data Science Intern
The data science team is responsible for solving business problems on complex data. Data complexity could be characterized in terms of volume, dimensionality and multiple touchpoints/sources. We understand the data, ask fundamental-first-principle questions and apply our analytical and machine learning skills to solve the problem in the best way possible. The problems that we tackle are focused on our 2 products/IP related to anti-money laundering
(AML) and financial exception management. In addition, the team plays a pivotal role in shaping company IP, primarily in area of approach, model selection, model tuning and feature engineering, so that engineering can take this up and automate the same via a pipeline.

WHAT WE DO
Niometrics captures, organises and extracts insights from some of the biggest and most complicated datasets that our modern societies currently produce. We put a magnifying glass on the realities collectively constructed by billions of connected individuals and machines, making sense of how humanity is re-creating wholly new digital universes with bits and bytes – universes that need to be seen, interpreted and explained. From taking deep dives into digital behaviours, to exploring the most intimate interactions between network technology and user experiences, we do it all.

About the job
Moneysmart is hiring a Data Team lead to help lead our team of young, eager data engineers and analysts. Together you and your team will work to build a stable and scalable data infrastructure that will be able to help the business to collect, process and store masses of raw information securely, accurately and efficiently. With all that information on hand, we’ll be looking to you to help us design and build amazing data products to improve user experiences on our Moneysmart sites as well as build up the business intelligence capabilities within our organization.
We’re looking for someone who is experienced and has done similar work like this elsewhere before. You will be working closely with people from other departments like Product, Marketing and Strategy to help understand their needs and design solutions that will enable them to deliver on their goals. Examples of this could be:
Onboarding customer data from external systems so further analysis can be conducted on it and we can discover/better understand customer preferences and trends
Building a recommendation engine that can recommend products based on user’s past choices, creating a more personalized and desirable experience
Creating a near real time reporting platform so that the country managers can get information in a more timely manner to make decisions quickly
To be able to do all these, you’ll need to plan and manage the Data Team’s roadmap well and help prioritize the work that needs to be done so that we can see the awesome impact it could bring sooner rather than later.
You will be expected to be technical as well. Being able to build data pipelines, write code and tune database queries will be a requirement since you’ll need to review and vet the work your team has done. The engineers will be looking to you to learn about best practices in building pipelines and running analysis, industry standards on data infrastructure and what clean, maintainable code looks like. The team currently writes most of their code in Python and SQL at the moment (we use R sometimes as well). But fluency in any other Big Data framework language will be highly welcome.
Our data engineers and analysts are a smart and talented bunch but they will require leadership and direction from their lead (which is you), someone who has been through the many phases of what it takes to build and maintain a production level data infrastructure, has seen the pitfalls and can help show them the way. Besides providing technical expertise to the team, a core part of this role will be to help mentor and develop the members of your team (as well as other developers in our department) professionally, and work towards creating a conducive environment for developers to thrive, making Moneysmart an ideal place to work and grow your career.
If you’re ready to take up the important mantle of become a Data Team Lead in Moneysmart’s Technology department, send us your resume now! We would really love to hear from you.","Requirements

About the Role
At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to build a better Web.

We handle more than 10% of the world’s Internet traffic
We have over 6 Terabit of network transit capacity
We serve more web traffic than Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Instagram, Bing, & Wikipedia combined

Every day, more than 10,000 new customers sign-up for Cloudflare service
Every week, the average Internet user touches us more than 500 times
We serve data from over 80 points-of-presence around the world
We are still a small team, well-funded, growing quickly and focused on building a world-class company.
Our globally distributed network is core to what we do. We are looking for talented SREs to join our all-star team and scale our network as Cloudflare’s business grows.  The ideal candidate has deep insights into how the web works, with a strong knowledge of DNS, linux, TLS, and automation.  This is a great opportunity to be part of a small team building and running a high growth network.  You will build tools to constantly improve availability, performance, uptime and response times.  You will nurture a passion for an “automate everything” approach that makes systems failure-resistant and ready-to-scale.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.
Project Athenian: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.
Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.
1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

We are seeking a strong and motivated candidate for the position of Research Associate in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems, with research focus on a tool development and deployment of distributed CPS. This work will enable the development of a digital-twin, which represents various processes of a factory in a smart manufacturing environment. This position is part of a corporate lab initiative involving NTU and Delta Electronics, a leading electronics manufacturing company. The expected start date for the position is January 2019, and the expected duration of the position is 2 years. Remuneration will be attractive and commensurate based on the qualifications and suitability for the project.
The candidate is expected to have a Masters degree in Computer Sciences and Computer Engineering, or related fields. The candidate must demonstrate strong experience in one or more of the following areas:
Proven experience in core development with one of: Java (preferred), C# or Python.
Understanding of RDBM concepts, and experience with ORMs and SQL.
Experience in Spring framework (Boot, MVC, and JPA).
Design and implementation of RESTful web services.
Understanding of build tools such as Gradle or Maven.
Experience in unit testing (Junit) and test automation processes.
Nice to haves:
Experience in C/C++.
Front-end development framework such as Angular or Vue.js.
Experience in both design as well as implementation of technologies for cyber-physical systems is highly desirable. The position is expected to provide an excellent opportunity to perform both fundamental as well as translational research in close collaboration with industry.
Project Overview: With sensing technology becoming pervasive in manufacturing plants, large amounts of data are being generated in real-time. As a consequence, there is a fundamental need to effectively utilize this “big data” so that many of the desired objectives of Industry 4.0 such as predictive maintenance, agile manufacturing and re-configurability, can be realized. The concept of a digital twin to transform big data into meaningful information about the plant has a wide range of applications. The digital twin can be viewed as an accurate and time-synchronized characterization of the physical plant in the cyber domain.
In this project, we propose to develop a model-based design and deployment framework to realize the concept of a digital twin. Model-based design enables the use of correct-by-construction methodology to generate code for both the physical plant controllers as well as the digital twin, thus ensuring the accuracy of the twin as well as its compatibility with plant controllers. Motivated by the idea of synchrony hypothesis, the project aims to develop a tool suite with the following objectives: 1) Plant and controller model specification and simulation to characterize the digital twin, and 2) Automatic model-to-code transformation for controller and digital twin synthesis.
